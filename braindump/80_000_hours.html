<p>
To have a truly fulfilling life, we need to turn outwards rather than inwards. Rather than asking “What’s my passion?,” ask “How can I best contribute to the world?” <a href="./books/80,000 Hours.pdf#page=217">pg. 217</a>
</p>

<p>
To do what contributes, build useful skills and apply them to meaningful
problems. Here’s the three key stages to focus on over time:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Explore</li>
<li>Build career capital to become as great as you can be.</li>
<li>Deploy.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
To have a dream job, 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>don’t worry too much about money and stress, and</li>
<li>don’t endlessly self-reflect to find your one true passion.</li>
<li>Rather, get good at something that helps others.</li>
</ul>

If everyone in the richest 10% of the world’s population donated 10% of their income, that would be $5 trillion per year. That would be enough to double scientific research funding, raise everyone in the world above the $2.15 per day poverty line, provide universal basic education, and still have plenty left to fund a renaissance in the arts, go to Mars, and then invest $1 trillion in mitigating climate change. None of this would be straightforward to achieve, but it at least illustrates the enormous potential of greater giving.49  <a href="./books/80,000 Hours.pdf#page=52">pg. 52</a>

When you look at the problems we’re most concerned about — like preventing future pandemics or reducing risks from AI systems — many are mainly constrained by a need for additional research.. 
</p>

<p>
Research is especially promising when you’re a very good fit, because the best researchers achieve much more than the median. <a href="./books/80,000 Hours.pdf#page=100">pg. 100</a>

While lots of research happens in academia, there are also many research positions elsewhere.

By “career capital,” we mean anything that puts you in a better position to make a difference or secure a fulfilling career in the future.
</p>

<p>
Early in your career, it’s more important to ensure you invest in your skills and get the training you need to maximise your long-term impact.
</p>

<p>
Focusing on impact too much too early can even be shortsighted, because it can preclude being in an even better position later. This means that for most people, the top priority early in their career is to build what we call career capital.

<p>
Unfortunately, however, all else is often not equal. While specialist career capital gives you fewer options, it’s often necessary to enter the most impactful jobs, so it’s still probably worth focusing on at some point.

<p>
Career capital is anything that puts you in a better position to make a difference in the future, including skills, connections, credentials, character, and financial runway. To get career capital, we suggest getting good at something useful. To do that, you need to: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Focus on learning valuable skills.</li>
<li>Learn skills that are a good fit for you.</li>
<li>Practice for many years with good mentorship.</li>
<li>Increase your chances of being in the right place at the right time (e.g. by working in new and rapidly growing fields).  <a href="./books/80,000 Hours.pdf#page=143">pg. 143</a></li>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>The results of our decisions take a long time to arrive.</li>

If it’s hard to predict where you’ll perform best ahead of time, and going with your gut intuition doesn’t work, then we need to take an empirical approach:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make some best guesses (hypotheses) about which options seem best.</li>
<li>Identify your key uncertainties about those hypotheses.</li>
<li>Go and investigate those uncertainties.</li>

<p>
And even when your investigation is complete and you start a job, that too is another experiment. After you’ve tried the job for a couple of years, update your best guesses, and repeat.

Suppose you’ve decided to try a job for a few years. You now face a tradeoff: should you stick with it, or quit with the hope of finding something better? Many successful people explored a lot early in their career.  <a href="./books/80,000 Hours.pdf#page=159">pg. 159</a>

Although most advice about being happier isn’t based on anything much, the last few decades has seen the rise of “positive psychology” — the science of the causes of wellbeing
</p>


<p>
Below is a list of techniques recommended by Professor Martin Seligman, one of the founders of the field. Most of these are in his book, Flourish. Some of these techniques have been successfully replicated265 and multiple recent meta-studies have found statistically significant positive effects of all of these techniques. Test them out, and keep using them if they’re helpful.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rate your happiness at the end of each day.</li>
<li>Start gratitude journaling. Write down three things you’re grateful for at the end of each day, and why they happened.</li>
<li>Use your signature strengths: Make sure you use one of your top five strengths each day.</li>

Try out a mindfulness practice — usually meditation

<p>
There’s a significant amount of evidence from trials that meditation helps with wellbeing, stress, mental health, focus, empathy, and more  <a href="./books/80,000 Hours.pdf#page=246">pg. 246</a>
</p></li>

<li>Practise active constructive responding to celebrate successes with others</li>

On average, in financial terms, college is a great investment. Researchers on this topic widely agree that going to college significantly boosts your income, even after you account for (i) lost earnings while studying (ii) the fact that the people who go to college are often more able, which means they’ll earn more anyway. <a href="./books/80,000 Hours.pdf#page=310">pg. 310</a>

<p>
One famous study in the US found that students who were accepted to an ‘elite’ university but turned it down, went on to earn just as much. This suggests that elite universities are selecting more talented people, but not actually helping them be more successful (with the exception of low-income students, who did earn more).  <a href="./books/80,000 Hours.pdf#page=312">pg. 312</a>
