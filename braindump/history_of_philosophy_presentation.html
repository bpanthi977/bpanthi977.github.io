father of western philosophy
</p>

<p>
It is said that following a visit to the Oracle of Delphi he spent much of his life questioning anyone in Athens who would engage him, in order to disprove the oracular prophecy that there would be no man wiser than Socrates
</p>


<p>
Once Socrates realized that the reason he was wiser than everyone is because he can admit that he knows nothing, he set out to correct the citizens of Athens and fix their assumptions and preconceptions. 
</p>

<p>
he just started accosting anyone unfortunate enough to not look busy. I'm wondering if you can help me get to the bottom of something&#x2026;what is justice? or what is virtue? people would give their, obviously flawed response, and he would just lay into them&#x2026;questioning them pointing out contradictions or exceptions and eventually getting to a place where the person was either angry at him because he made them feel stupid or angry at him because he wouldn’t leave them alone. either way they were angry. 
</p>


<p>
Socrates wasn’t saying what he was saying to try to get the charges dropped&#x2026;
he was saying what he was saying with the same motives he had for doing everything else in his life&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
to live a "good" and virtuous life.
</p>

<p>
He was one of the first philosophers to ask&#x2026;what is a "good" life? and in his opinion, a good life was getting&#x2026; a sort of "peace of mind"&#x2026; as a result of doing the right thing, as opposed to doing things simply because society tells you its a good idea. He didn’t agree with Protagoras and most of the sophists who believed morals were relative
</p>
