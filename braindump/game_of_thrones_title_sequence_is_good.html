<blockquote>
<p>
A TV show title sequence (or intro) presents credits, establishes the setting and sets the tone of the show. Game of Thrones was a show with a large number of characters and locations. Making it difficult for the viewer to keep track of and engage with the story. To help with this, the producers juiced the title sequence. Showing a map with labelled locations. The camera moves to the locations where the current episode will take place. As the story progressed, more locations would be added. Gradually building the viewer's knowledge. Old locations were also modified based on what took place in previous episodes. This helps the viewer understand the geography and reminds them of previous events. Improving engagement with the story.
