<p>
<a href="language.html#ID-82E3DD81-F82A-45BB-9438-705B629F449F">Language</a> is a very low-bandwidth method for transmitting information: isolated words or sentences, shorn of context, convey little. Moreover, because of the sheer number of homonyms and pronouns, many sentences are deeply ambiguous.
</p>

<p>
As <a href="noam_chomsky.html#ID-F8C60273-A98E-4D06-BF1C-968CC9CFC77C">Chomsky</a> and his acolytes have pointed out for decades, language is just not a clear and unambiguous vehicle for clear communication.
</p>

<p>
But humans don’t need a perfect vehicle for communication because we share a nonlinguistic understanding. Context allows us to infer. 
Abandoning the view that all knowledge is linguistic permits us to realize how much of our knowledge is nonlinguistic.
</p>

<p>
The ability to explain a concept linguistically is different from the ability to use it practically.
</p>

<p>
Once we scratch beneath the surface, it is easier to see how limited these systems really are: they have the attention span and memory of roughly a paragraph.

<p>
While books contain a lot of information we can decompress and use, so do many other objects: IKEA instructions don’t even bother writing out instructions alongside its drawings; AI researchers often look at the diagrams in a paper first,
</p>

<p>
The structures of artifacts and the human environment convey a lot of information intuitively: doorknobs are at hand height, hammers have soft grips and so on. Nonlinguistic mental simulation, in animals and humans, is common and useful for planning out scenarios
</p>

<p>
A system trained on language alone will never approximate human intelligence, even if trained from now until the heat death of the universe.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Language may be a helpful component which extends our understanding of the world, but language doesn’t exhaust intelligence, as is evident from many species, such as corvids, octopi and primates.
