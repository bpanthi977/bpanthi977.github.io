</p>

<p>
This paper summarizes a talk given at “Lisp50@OOPSLA,” the 50th
Anniversary of Lisp workshop, Monday, October 20, 2008, an event co-located with 
the OOPSLA’08 in Nashville, TN, in which I offered  my personal, subject ive  account  
of how I came to be involved with Common Lisp and the Common Lisp standard, 
and of what I learned from the process.
</p>


<p>
Someone once claimed to me that the problems with
standards work is that the process is so exhausting that no one who ever
finishes the task wants to try another, so everyone involved is always brand
new and no knowledge ever propagates from cycle to cycle. This isn’t literally
true, but there is still some truth to it.
</p>

<p>
As part of the MACSYMA group,
I began work on an undergraduate thesis project,
which was to write a FORTRAN-to-LISP
translator for use in translating the IMSLFORTRAN library, making it available for MACSYMA
</p>

<p>
The original design of the Common Lisp language, culminating
in the 1984 publication of Common Lisp: The Language was designed not by an 
ANSI committee but just by a set of interested individuals. I was not a 
founding member of the group, although my officemate Guy Steele was. I was vaguely
aware that there was some sort of thing afoot, but my specific involvement came 
slightly later through the same kind of accidental path that had led me to
Lisp itself.
</p>


<p>
Because many
of these facilities used different dialects of LISP,
ARPA was inclined to try to get them all
to use the same dialect. They were leaning toward concluding that INTERLISP 
was the dialect of choice because it
seemed to be deployed at more locations than any other single dialect, but a
case was made that many MACLISP variants
were really the same dialect and could be collected under a single Common Lisp
banner.
</p>

<p>
In effect, there was a fight to the death between
Common Lisp and INTERLISP because ARPA 
was not willing to fund work in both dialects going forward. And after 
Common Lisp: The Language was published, Common Lisp
succeeded and INTERLISP largely disappeared
within a small number of years.
</p>


<p>
Someone once observed to me, however, that the cost
of any such battle is that later the individuals who have lost out or otherwise
been alienated will eventually need to be repatriated with the community. At
that point, some compromise is often needed in order to bring them back 
</p>


<p>
The pace of change was quite exciting for those doing research on 
programming languages, but it was far less good to those
trying to build programs that used the programming language as a stable
commodity. Commercial development required more.
</p>


<p>
Mail delivery was often delivered 
via a protocol called uucp (Unix to Unix copy) which required mail to
be explicitly routed by hops from one machine to another.
</p>

<p>
this meant it could take 2-3 days to get a message across the ocean and to 
receive a reply back.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to me, at least, that the creation of the
Eulisp effort in Europe was pretty much a
direct reaction to having been excluded from the American discussions of Common
Lisp.
</p>

<p>
There were a few more in-person meetings, all of which I believe I attended, although
most of the design was done by email. Much
later, in 1993, the specific online design processes we used were later studied
and written up by researchers at the MIT Sloan School 
[Yates93].
</p>


<p>
Around this time, the Symbolics Lisp Machine system
came out with an object-oriented paradigm for error handling. Called the “New
Error System” (or “NES”), it was described in a document 
titled Signaling and Handling Conditions. 
[Moon83]
</p>

<p>
I was amused to hear one Lisp Machine user say
“Finally, a second use for Flavors.” Flavors was an
object-oriented paradigm that became a strong influence on the design of CLOS.
</p>

<p>
Even as it sought to culturally unify the MACLISP family of
dialects, the emerging language necessarily contained numerous incompatible
changes that required some getting used to.
</p>


<p>
Probably the most sweeping change was the
introduction of a claim that the semantics of the language would apply equally
whether the language was used interpreted or compiled.
</p>


<p>
MACLISP, for example, had different variable binding semantics
for interpreted and compiled code.
</p>

<p>
Common Lisp was also base 10 rather than base 8. 
A surprising amount of noise was made about this seemingly innocuous change.
Arguments were made by people used to doing system programming that base 8,
being a power of 2, was more natural.
</p>

<p>
(Interestingly, it was almost never
suggested that hexadecimal was an appropriate base, which was probably due to
the  36-bit word size used by the PDP-10, which was customarily divided into
four 9-bit bytes, five 7-bit bytes, or six 6-bit bytes.)  Not surprisingly,
however, the general public found great appeal in use of decimal as a default radix.
</p>


<p>
In 1984, Common Lisp: The Language (or CLTL) 
[Steele84]
was published.
</p>


<p>
One problem was that Common Lisp was more descriptive than prescriptive.
</p>

<p>
As the user base later grew and program porting became a
more widespread practice, the community will to invest in such matters grew.
But at the time when CLTL was
published, a sense that the language design must focus on true portability had
not yet evolved.
</p>

<p>
The distinction between user guides and reference
guides was also still evolving. Steele chose to make CLTL both a user
guide and a reference.
</p>

<p>
he community generally liked the presentation, and even
today many people prefer to use CLTL as a reference, even knowing
it’s not true to the language, just because they like the presentation
style. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to all these subjective and
presentational issues, CLTL also had a few much more
fundamental weaknesses, most acutely the absence of an error system. As I was
fond of expressing it at that time: A majority of the functions described by CLTL
were capable of signaling errors under at least some conditions, not all of
which were things a program could test for in advance, and yet if an error was
signaled, there was no way to catch that error under program control. That
meant that no serious program could operate in a portable way and expect to
avoid trouble. There were other technical gaps, too, but this was severe. In
retrospect, had CLTL offered even just MACLISP’s
ERRSET it would have been a
great deal better off.
</p>

<p>
In spite of some substantial shortcomings, members
of the Lisp community did rally behind Common Lisp as the language of choice
for moving forward. Following the publication of CLTL, the Common Lisp
language was soon widely heralded as a “de
facto standard.”
</p>

<p>
Vendors tried to gain commercial traction and users tried to build applications.
After about two years, though, there was feedback based on actual use that needed
some kind of outlet, so a meeting was arranged in Monterey, California to talk
about what would come next.
</p>


<p>
One serious problem was that a lot of new people had shown up—the users.
And there was no plan for how to incorporate their votes. 
Some of us (myself included) thought the users should not have a vote 
because it was not their language. It was alleged to me that the users’ 
investment was in using the language. That was a new concept for me and
I did not immediately resonate to it, although I have come to see this as a
legitimate point of view.
</p>

<p>
I later learned there had been the beginnings of a process
to create an ISO standard for Lisp, so in that light I suppose that involving
ANSI was something of a defensive action.
My understanding of the significance of the ISO issue came after-the-fact,
but I am told it was key at this point in time in the
decision to involve ANSI.
</p>


<p>
Never having been part of a formal standards process, I
didn’t quite know what to expect. The very fact that there are a lot of rules was
very daunting and confusing. 
</p>

<p>
Work was divided up. Committees were assigned to work on
various subtasks. 
</p>


<p>
It’s equally reasonable to note that while
inter-corporate tactical posturing may have appeared to serve the individual
vendors represented, it probably kept the vendors from cooperating in ways that
later turned out to be essential. Before the process could move forward, a new
understanding would have to be reached where we started to work more together,
and less at odds with one another.
</p>


<p>
various committees were formed to work on
various aspects of the standard,
</p>

<p>
Charter, Compiler, Conditions, Conformance,
Namespaces, Iteration, and Objects. In addition there was a catch-all committee
called Cleanup that handled small matters that didn’t seem to fit in any other
committee.
</p>


<p>
Sitting in a room for a good part of a meeting coming up
with words to write as part of our mission did not seem like a good use of time
to me at that moment.
</p>

<p>
In retrospect, I consider this a major administrative contribution and I
credit the committee chair, Susan Ennis, for getting us to do it.
</p>


<p>
What I found later was that there were many times during
work on the standard where people disagreed about what the right way to proceed
was. In many of those cases, we might have been hopelessly deadlocked, each
wanting to pursue a different agenda, but I was able instead to point to the
charter and say, “No, we agreed that this is how we’d resolve things like
this.”
</p>


<p>
the most useful sentence in the charter was
the one that said, “Aesthetic considerations shall also be weighed, but as
subordinate criteria”
</p>

<p>
[J13SD05].
Our goal in writing the charter had been to
produce an industrial-strength language, and the time spent writing that one
sentence, emphasizing the importance of pragmatics over abstract concerns about
elegance, broke a lot of deadlocks. 
</p>

<p>
The time spent writing the charter later paid for itself many times over 
and it’s an exercise I recommend to
any committee engaged in any large endeavor over a period of time.
</p>

<p>
Most people who have seen the Common Lisp HyperSpecTM[Pitman96]
have spent at least
some time browsing the X3J13 issues section, in which the nature of various
issues considered in the design of the language are recorded for history.
</p>

<p>
Using forms with standardized fields like “problem description”
and “proposal” where each proposal had to be analyzed for 
“cost to users,”
“cost to implementers,” etc. led those submitting changes 
to consider their proposal from all sides before
making a suggestion. It also made it easy for reviewers to determine
which proposed changes were adequately explained and which were controversial.
</p>


<p>
It had an additional benefit that is a little more subtle.
There was implicitly a kind of philosophy of how contributions from
collaborating individuals were merged using these forms. For example, a good
problem description had to satisfy everyone. If two people saw a problem from a
different point of view, both people’s points of view were merged into the
problem description, making the problem more complicated, and making solutions
sometimes harder to achieve. But this was essential to addressing porting
problems, for example. One couldn’t just solve how a file system operation
would work on one operating system unless the solution was going to work on
other operating systems, too. On the other hand,
the “proposal” field was very
different. If two people disagreed on a proposal, they each wrote their own
proposal so that proposals could be internally consistent and coherent. This
meant that a single problem often had several proposed solutions with different
costs and benefits, and the committee had to decide which was
the stronger proposal.
</p>

<p>
The procedure worked well and solved hundreds of small
issues that came up. But it was not a property of the ANSI process that we used
this procedure. It was unique to Masinter’s way of doing things. This was just
one of many details of the process that was greatly affected by the presence of
and style of a single individual.
</p>

<p>
CLTL had been accepted as a “base document.” 
Under Kathy’s supervision, and with Steele’s explicit approval,
CLTL was reorganized from its tutorial style to a dictionary style, 
working out many of the book design details that would 
carry through into the final work.
</p>

<p>
Within the code, she kept meticulous back-pointers to the
source location of each of the bits of moved text so that it was later possible
to track down the origin of passages that surprised people. 
</p>


<p>
At this time also, work began by an ISO committee
designated as SC22/WG16,
an international standards body concerned with Lisp. (Later, at the request of
John McCarthy, Lisp’s creator, this body would clarify that its goal was to
produce a dialect named ISLISP,
and not to produce a standard for all Lisp.
In fact, in researching this paper I found records from an early meeting
of X3J13 stating that McCarthy had made a similar request there, 
too—that the American standard be one for Common Lisp, not for Lisp.)
</p>


<p>
In 1989, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC),
having already invested a substantial amount in hosting a Project Editor,
decided it wanted someone else to take over the role.
There was a call for a new Project Editor.
</p>


<p>
What it needed was someone who had a mix of skills,
and I had a reasonably good mix. It needed me to be a technical person one day
and a writer on other days. 
</p>


<p>
Also, if it was going to involve someone with
technical skills, it needed that person to be someone who was able to separate
partisan technical advocacy (which could be done at meetings) from neutral
editorial action (while editing the document). There was a lot of text
changing, and it needed to change in purely editorial ways. Had I confused my
being allowed to edit the document for editorial reasons with my being allowed
to edit the document for technical reasons, the community
would have lost faith in me. They needed to believe that I would work hard to
make sure that the only changes made to the standard were those consistent with
technical votes taken in the committee.
</p>


<p>
Editing, I found, is really mostly about trust.
</p>

<p>
The process dragged on. AI winter was taking hold.
There was a sense that companies that wanted to make or use Common Lisp could
start falling by the wayside if a usable standard was not produced soon.
</p>


<p>
Although Franz Inc. was a business competitor with
my employer at the time, Symbolics Inc., the relationship between the various
Lisp vendors had improved and it was becoming clear to all that they had a
common “enemy”: C++.
</p>


<p>
Because of this, an unusual thing happened: Franz
Inc. set about locating funding for the editing work I was to do while at
Symbolics
</p>

<p>
Importantly, there was no sense in which the work
to create these was contracted by X3J13 itself.  The job of the committee was
not to decide 
</p>

<p>
wording of the final
spec, but rather to decide truth.
Since copyright is about control of the form
of an expression, and not the content
</p>

<p>
,
X3J13 had not involved itself as an author, nor had it paid for the work. This
would matter later.
</p>

<p>
Under some pressure from Digital Press to produce a new edition of CLTL,
Steele finally complied in 1990 by publishing Common Lisp: The Language,
Second Edition 
[Steele90],
sometimes also known as CLTL2.
With that act, the landscape of Lisp language descriptions got a 
lot more complicated.
</p>


<p>
In fact, some of the functionality that had been
already approved when Steele’s book went to press was later rescinded. In
theory, that was not an issue since the committee had published no standard.
</p>

<p>
An example was the so-called “ environmental
inquiry ” functions (not the traditional UNIXgetenv operation, but rather functions allowing macros to reflect on the state of the
lexical environment at macro expansion time, including type declarations). The
effort to do new design in a timeframe suitable for standardization was not
converging quickly enough. Basically, this functionality was 
considered desirable by the committee but was removed for fear
that it would become, to use Steele’s language, “inscribed in stone” before
their bugs were fixed. And yet, because of Steele’s new book, they already 
were inscribed in stone, at least
pending an actual ANSI standard.
</p>


<p>
At the last minute, X3J13 received advice about
international character sets from the Japan Electronic Industry Development
Association (JEIDA) Common Lisp committee.
In addition to a rationale document, “JEIDA Nihongo Common Lisp Guideline,”
authored by Masayuki Ida and Takumi Doi, a specific proposal in the ordinary
X3J13 issue format was provided by Masayuki Ida. After some simplifications
were made, the proposal for issue EXTERNAL-FORMAT-FOR-EVERY-FILE-CONNECTION
was voted on at the April 1, 1992 meeting and ultimately accepted.
</p>


<p>
In March 1992, a draft was ready for public review. This
raised the level of the document to a draft proposed American National
Standard, sometimes called dpANS Common Lisp.
</p>


<p>
In 1992, Symbolics Inc. was doing poorly
financially
</p>

<p>
so it was not very surprising that I became a casualty of another in a
series of layoffs
</p>

<p>
One morning, I woke up quite early and decided to
write an emulation of the ISLISP language
in Symbolics Common Lisp. I found this to be generally easy to do, except for a
couple of small problems. LAMBDA was
required to operate in the SCHEME style in
ISLISP, 
without a surrounding FUNCTION special form,
but CL did not support this. 
Also, ISLISP had global lexical variables and a
different semantics for DEFCONSTANT.
I took notes on these problems and wrote feedback on the standard to be
submitted as Public Review comments on behalf of the ISLISP community.
These comments later led to the availability of
LAMBDA as a macro form in ANSI Common Lisp, as well as to the
presence of the DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO
operator.
</p>


<p>
As a matter of history, there were various aspects of Public
Review that were interesting. To tell them all would take more space than I
have.
</p>


<p>
In 1994, the standard was approved for publication.
</p>


<p>
Subject matter expertise and writing skill were important
factors for any success as an editor, but I think that in the end neither of
these was the most important.
</p>


<p>
With a document this large and a time span this long, it was
necessary that the community have complete trust that the only reason
a change might be made to the meaning of the language
was if there was a corresponding technical change voted by the committee. 
</p>


<p>
From time to time, people would request small changes that
they insisted were mostly editorial, and I had to resist the urge to comply
with such requests even though the suggestions often did seem like good ideas
from a technical point of view.
</p>


<p>
I would sometimes say the job was to transform text from
“implicitly vague” to “explicitly vague.” 
The job was definitely not to make up meaning out of nowhere.
</p>


<p>
So, in retrospect, I would reiterate that the primary
qualification for Editorship was trustworthiness—particularly, the ability to
resist the urge to “meddle” in technical matters while acting in the role of
“neutral editor.”
</p>



<p>
Although approved in 1994, it took almost a full extra year
to get this large document printed. Various things still had to happen. It
would not be until 1995 that the document would be published.
</p>


<p>
I was employed by Harlequin, telecommuting from my
home, while finalizing the standard. My liaison at ANSI had contacted me about
some small edits they wanted made prior to formal publication of the
already-approved standard, primarily changes to the look of headers and the
fact that a bunch of page numbers were wrong in the appendix.
</p>


<p>
Oh, and they wanted us to give them the copyright.
</p>


<p>
“I can’t do that,” I explained by phone one day, 
remembering my problems with MIT and copyrights from years before.
“My work has been done under contract with a great many people
who have paid for the work to be done,
on condition that it be placed into the public domain.”
</p>


<p>
The person I was talking to alleged that standards
are owned by the committee that makes them. This flew in the face of my
understanding of how copyright worked. I thought copyright was owned by the
author or, when the author was paid to do the writing, by the entity that had
paid the author.
</p>


<p>
A court case was cited that sounded dubious to me.
Since it was a phone call, I have no written record of the precise case. My
vague recollection was that it was a regional case, nothing that had gone to
the Supreme Court. Allegedly, the case created some precedent for the notion
that if a committee writes something as a group, the committee holds copyright
in the result.
</p>


<p>
“Oh,” I explained, “we didn’t do it that way. Our
committee only voted on the truth of things, not on the text.”
</p>


<p>
Having previously done a great deal of reading on
the issue of copyright, I knew that the US Code for copyright 
[USC17]
is rather specific on this point.
The code pretty clearly says that
</p>

<p>
“Copyright
protection subsists [&#x2026;] in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible
medium of expression”
</p>

<p>
In no case does copyright protection
for an original work extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of
operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it
is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.”
</p>

<p>
In other
words, copyright protects the form of an idea but not the idea itself. 
And since X3J13 had concerned
itself with the creation of documents about truth, not with the creation of
documents telling me what to write, X3J13
as a group had specifically and intentionally elected not to be an author of
the resulting document.
</p>


<p>
“Copyright,” I explained, “covers the form of text,
not the truth. So it doesn’t seem likely that such a court precedent would
apply.”
</p>

<p>
“Also,” I continued, “X3J13
isn’t a legal entity. So we don’t think it could own anything. That’s why we
wrote contracts among ourselves to accomplish the funding of the project, not
contracts with the committee.”
</p>


<p>
“And anyway,” I went on, “the cash flow is in the
wrong direction. You [ANSI] are
taking in money for X3J13 fees. You’re not
paying us, we’re paying you. Maybe if you were paying us, you might own our
work. But we’re paying you for
membership. Moreover, we’ve paid about $425,000 in enumerable expenses for
salary of people who worked on making the standard. We bought the creation of
the standard and we’re not giving it away to ANSI.”
</p>


<p>
“We, as a community, expect to continue to own the
spec. My understanding is that copyright typically resides with whoever pays
for the creation, so I doubt that could be ANSI. My recollection is that I told
them I was surprised that they could have built their business on such a
strange foundation—the strength of a single court case.
</p>


<p>
“We could just decide to go ahead and make the
changes ourselves,” I was told. “Oh,” I explained, “that wouldn’t be good. Our
names are on the document, you wouldn’t want to be publishing something we
didn’t write under our name. That sounds like it could be fraud or something.”
</p>


<p>
“Well, we could use what you’ve already given us.”
“Gee, I said, it has all those headers you don’t like and that index with all
the wrong page numbers. I doubt you’d want that.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, we could just retract the standard. It’s not
published yet. We could just not publish it. Oh, I said, that would be very
helpful to us because Steele went and published CLTL2 and it’s
created a lot of confusion in the market. We’d be happy to just use that, since
that’s what everyone is implementing right now anyway.”
</p>


<p>
You could
probably take a page from the way West Law does US court cases and copyright
the headers and the page breaks, not the underlying text, and then say that
although the main document is not yours, the official copy, the one that is the
standard, is the one with all those headers of yours, and that can only be
obtained from you
</p>

<p>
“But, bottom line,” I explained, “I’m not authorized
to sign over any copyright to you and I’m not going to do that.”
</p>


<p>
In 1993, the Mosaic web browser was released to the
world by NCSA, although I personally mark
the birth of the web in 1994. I saw the Shoemaker-Levy comet impact on the web
and then a little while later on television and it suddenly struck me that if
the Internet could get me information faster than the news, the world would
never be the same.
</p>


<p>
I had been working on the creation of a hypertext
version of ANSI Common Lisp using the proprietary notation that Harlequin used
for its Lisp documentation. It struck me that it might be useful to construct
an HTML back end instead, in order to be
able to browse the documentation in Mosaic.
It was an easy change to make and pretty soon the first version of the 
Common Lisp HyperSpec was available for internal use at Harlequi
</p>


<p>
The document was about 16MB and contained 105,000 links
</p>

<p>
There was no way to know for sure, but it
seemed to me that it might be one of the biggest documents on the web at that
point, and that it would draw attention not only to LispWorks as a product but
to the possibilities of the web and of Lisp just because of how it was
generated.
</p>


<p>
In 1995, Guy Steele released a 
webbed version of Common Lisp: The Language, Second Edition.
</p>

<p>
Most of the world was thrilled by this. I was crushed.
Harlequin had sufficiently delayed the release of CLHS that I was
quite sure it would never be published. At best, my
effort would seem like a last-minute afterthought inspired by Steele’s work.
</p>


<p>
But the idea of doing something on the web was
growing in popularity as people had come to understand the significance of the
web better. A competing theory, also my own idea, was that CLHS should be what I then
described as an “advertising virus.” By “virus” I didn’t mean anything
sinister. I meant only that the document would be copied from place to place by
people wanting to read and use it. Harlequin’s corporate logo was firmly
affixed to it by copyright requirements, so would be copied along with it.
</p>


<p>
I also resisted strong pressure to add features in the document to 
take advantage of this or that HTTP service, 
perhaps providing search capabilities or other active features.
The index and cross-references were carefully designed to give functionality
without requiring special HTTP support so that the document was made 
of pure HTML and could run anywhere that an HTML document could exist. 
</p>


<p>
It is sometimes easy to indulge the illusion that
activities like language design and standardization are magically governed by
the same kinds of rule-based orderliness that we like to apply to the
collateral manipulated by such activities, such as programs and programming
languages. Yet, as with many collaborative human endeavors, chaos, chance and
luck all played their part in shaping the outcome.
</p>


<p>
 the requirements for the successful
completion of the task were, I think, broader than we might have been focusing
on. Had the group focused exclusively on getting someone who was a formal
semantics expert, that person might have lacked the requisite writing skill.
Had they sought someone with specific credentials in writing, there might have
been some other absent capability. My background seemed to be what was needed
to get the job done. Even my early misfortune with the copyright for my MACLISP
manual informed my later dealings with ANSI about the copyright for the
standard.
</p>

<p>
One might wish to regard the output document of a
standard as formal or scientific in various ways, but my sense is that 
the process of making such a standard is not
very scientific—certainly our process was not scientific.
In general, chance and good fortune mattered. 
Small actions sometimes had profound effects. 
Cash flow mattered at various places in important ways, as did control of
intellectual property. 
</p>



<p>
The process was a messy one, but it went well. I
hope that by candidly discussing some of the issues involved in the process,
there is something to learn for other so that future such messy processes will
nevertheless be successful as well.
