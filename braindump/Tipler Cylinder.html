Tipler's Original Paper: <a href="./../Main/Science/Rotating cylinders and the possibility of global causality violation - tipler1974.pdf">Rotating cylinders and the possibility of global causality violation - tipler1974 pg. 1</a>
</p>

<p>
A Tipler Cylinder uses a massive and long 
 cylinder spinning around its longitudinal axis. The rotation 
 creates a frame-dragging effect and fields of closed time-like 
 curves traversable in a way to achieve subluminal time travel to 
 the past.
</p>

<p>
Tiplerâ€™s cylinder has to be infinitely long.
</p>

<p>
The Tipler cylinder was discovered as a solution to the 
 equations of general relativity by Willem Jacob van Stockum in 
 1936 and Kornel Lanczos in 1924, but not recognized as allowing 
 closed timelike curves until an analysis by Frank Tipler in

<p>
Tipler showed in his 1974 paper, "Rotating Cylinders and 
 the Possibility of Global Causality Violation"
</p>

<p>
CTC's are associated, in Lorentzian manifolds which are 
 interpreted physically as spacetimes, with the possibility of 
 causal anomalies such as going back in time
</p>

<p>
An objection to the practicality of building a Tipler cylinder 
 was discovered by Stephen Hawking
</p>

<p>
it is impossible to 
 build a time machine in any finite region that satisfies the 
 weak energy condition, meaning that the region contains no 
 exotic matter with negative energy. 
</p>

<p>
Hawking's proof appears in 
 his 1992 paper on the chronology protection conjecture,
