Incomplete Cholesky, are black box methods that are typically used to generate these preconditioners. These methods normally require trying techniques such as scaling, shifting, and identifying fill-in to achieve the desired reduction in iterations. However, the algorithm of incomplete factorization tends to be difficult to parallelize due to the low computational intensity.

<p>
NN generally does better than NNN. This is a nice finding for two particular reasons. First, normal- ization does not need to be done, thus saving time in training. Second, the training of NN is much less sensitive. In particular, a simple parameter of α = 0.1 works well with AdaGrad for training, while the training of NNN is much more difficult.

In theory, the reduction in fill-in should result in better preconditioners.
