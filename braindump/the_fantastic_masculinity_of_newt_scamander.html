<span class="underline">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</span>
</p>

<p>
Newt Scamander, protagonist of this Harry Potter spin-off, is an <b>unconventional male hero</b>. He performs a <b>refreshingly atypical form of masculinity</b> especially for the lead in a fantasy adventure story.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-Masculanity%20we%20expect" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="Masculanity%20we%20expect"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Masculanity we expect</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We expect leading men who are, or learn to be, <b>autonomous, brazen, and physically strong</b>.</li>
<li>Or at least men who are <b>witty, boisterous, and charismatic</b>.</li>
<li>Preferably all of the above.</li>
<li>It's practically required for male heroes to <b>hide their vulnerability</b>.</li>
<li>We're accustomed to seeing men who are <b>quick to violence</b> and slow to diplomacy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
But his version of manhood doesn't stem from physical strength or combat skills or feats of daring-do, or even from some preordained mystic destiny like so many other male heroes.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-Characteristics" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="Characteristics"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Characteristics</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>His is a <b>quiet, vulnerable, yet confident form of manhood</b>.</li>
<li>Newt Scamander is <b>not the "chosen one."</b></li>
<li>He is <b>not plagued with self-doubt</b> about his abilities or his place in the magical world.</li>
<li><b>Newts truly special gift is not his magic. It's his empathy</b>.</li>
<li>And the story doesn't frme his social anxiety as an obstacle.</li>

<li>This type of quiet <b>sensitive masculinity</b> is so out of the ordinary for a leading man that I wasn't terribly surprised to see a number of movie reviewers turned off by his character.</li>
<li>Newt's character is largely defined by his <b>extraordinary ability to connect with magical creatures</b> and by his relative inability to connect with other human beings.</li>
<li>This is also <b>not an "animal good, human bad" story</b>. Even though he's painfully shy and socially awkward <b>Newt's empathetic worldview extends to people</b>, especially to those discriminated against or marginalized.</li>
<li>He's strongly opposed to segregation, discriminatory laws, capital punishment, and other violence committed in the name of justice.</li>
<li>He's sincere, nurturing, emotional, and sensitive.</li>

<li>But <b>Newt is not Harry Potter</b>. He's a Hufflepuff. The House characterized by friendship, hard work, and humility. Hufflepuffs are said to be more down-to-earth and less competitive than the other three wizarding houses. Harry Potter, on the other hand, was sorted into Gryffindor, the House known for daring, nerve, chivalry, and prone to a fair bit of showing off. As such, Harry fits neatly into the pantheon of traditional Hollywood heroes.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-Social%20Anxiety%20is%20not%20an%20obstacle" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="Social%20Anxiety%20is%20not%20an%20obstacle"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Social Anxiety is not an obstacle</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Characters like this tend to fall into a few specific archetypes.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's the <span class="underline">Tormented Genius</span>: a brilliant but insufferable character who's intelligent to the point of instability or mental illness which is often framed as "the price" he must pay for his extraordinary talent.</li>
<li>There's the <span class="underline">Mad Scientist</span>: a whimsical or bumbling character whose weird eccentricities are perhaps endearing to a degree&#x2026;</li>
<li>And then there's the <span class="underline">Sherlock Holmes</span> archetype: a character possessing such a superhuman IQ that it leads to callousness and the <b>inability or perhaps unwillingness to feel sympathy for other people</b>.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Critically, <b>Fantastic Beasts doesn't frame Newt's social anxiety as an obstacle</b> he must ultimately overcome in order to be a true hero. The narrative doesn't require him to "toughen up" or learn to be more outgoing.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-The%20ending" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="The%20ending"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> The ending</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The ending of Fantastic Beasts is rather anticlimactic compared to most other action fantasy movies and even compared to most other films in the Harry Potter universe. <span class="underline">Rather than besting his foe in an epic magical duel, Newt approaches the conflict with an eye for de-escalation</span>. Of course, in the end the malevolent force is vanquished, but it's not done by Newt's hand. Even more surprising, <span class="underline">this triumph of over evil isn't shown to be a cause for celebration</span>. It is instead framed as a melancholy event. Melancholy because <b>our heroes failed to save the monster</b>.
