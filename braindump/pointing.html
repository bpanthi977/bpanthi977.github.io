Pointing is applying a small amount of mortar into the face joint between bricks (either newly laid or in old brickwork). In new brickwork, pointing can apply harder mortar to increase weather protection on exposed faces. In old brickwork, pointing is often used to repair mortar joints which have been eroded by exposure to the elements. (<a href="https://www.diydata.com/techniques/brickwork/pointing/pointing.php">Source</a>)
</p>

<p>
Pointing is a technique of strengthening and repairs of brick masonry, block masonry or stone masonry mortar joints. In case when old mortar joints crack and disintegrate, then the defective mortar is removed by hand or power tool and replaced with <b>fresh mortar</b>.

<p>
Pointing, in building maintenance, the technique of repairing mortar joints between bricks or other masonry elements. When aging mortar joints crack and disintegrate, the defective mortar is removed by hand or power tool and replaced with fresh mortar, preferably of the same composition as the original. Often an entire wall, or even a whole structure, is pointed because defective points cannot easily be detected, and adjacent joints may also be in need of repair. The mortar is packed tightly in thin layers and tooled to a smooth, concave, finished surface. Tuck-pointing is a refinement of pointing, by which sharply defined points are formed for decorative purposes.

The construction term pointing refers to the finishing of mortar joints in masonry, be it stone or brick. Mortar often does not have as long a lifespan as the brick it holds together, and over the years must be periodically removed and replaced. Repointing is the process of removing deteriorated mortar from the joints of a masonry wall and replacing it with new mortar.

<p>
Pointing is the process of raking and applying rich mortar
with desired finishing in the joints of masonry.
• It is preferable when the joint has not completed final
setting time (in plastic state). It is easy to rake and apply
mortar in this condition.
</p>


<p>
The mortar used in pointing should be richer than masonry mortar.

</ul>

<p>
Mortar joints in exposed masonry are susceptible to weathering, which leads to water infiltration. This water infiltration, along with wind and pollution, causes the mortar to erode, and allows increase water infiltration. Mortar can also crack due to uneven settlement in a building’s foundation. As a structure settles into the ground over time, stress is transferred into the structure itself. This stress causes mortar joints to crack and peel, which again leads to further moisture entering the deteriorated mortar joints.

<p>
For a ‘flush’ joint profile no further working need be done. Because flush joints are formed without compacting the surface of the mortar they are less resistant to water penetration than profiles formed by tooling. For other joint profiles the mortar is left to stiffen slightly and then tooled. The time taken for the mortar to reach the correct consistency varies considerably and checking should start after approximately 10 minutes.

the mortar is pressed into joints by trowel and well finished off with the face of masonry surface. After that, the joint is pressed by back by small - diameter steel lengthwise (6 mm dia) It will form a curved arc groove into a mortar joint. The vertical joint also finishes similar manner. 
</p>

<p>
Concave pointing is formed by making the mortar flush with the face brick then struck with a brick jointer. The jointer keeps the mortar flush to the bed on the masonry units while slightly concaving the middle of the joint. Since it’s easy to achieve and offers a high level of weather protection, this joint is commonly used.

<p>
Recessed joints impede the flow of rainwater down the surface of the brickwork, which tends to get wetter than it does with other profiles. For this reason recessed joints are not recommended unless the bricks are eminently frost-resistant. 
</p>

<p>
They are not recommended in locations liable to severe exposure to wind-driven rain for brickwork in which resistance to water penetration is important.

. Weathered pointing is a modification of flush pointing. The face of the pointing is kept inclined, with its upper edge pressed inside the face by about 10 mm. Weathered pointing throws off rain water and is considered fairly durable; however, it’s fairly difficult to achieve.

Mortar pressed into a masonry joint and concave grooves are formed into a joint by using a stell tool having a concave shape. It gives an exvellent appearance to the mortar joint but is <b>liable to get damaged quickly</b>. So not used much.

Beaded pointing is used almost exclusively in historical restorations. Beaded joints can be much more noticeable, making the mortar joints part of the structure’s visual aesthetic.
