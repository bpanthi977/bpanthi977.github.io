<p>
Canada:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Easy/Deterministic</dt><dd>The procedure is more easy and deterministic in Canada.</dd>
<dt>More welcoming</dt><dd>Canadas takes the a lot of immigrants both highly skilled people and refugees.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
America:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Limited Intake</dt><dd>America's H1B visa procedure however has a limit 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>on total number of people accepted each year,</li>
<li>on number of people accepted from each country. So, country like India with high population is in disadvantage.</li>
</ul></dd>

<dt>Tied to Employer</dt><dd><a href="private/h1b_visa.html#ID-A86711BD-6955-4EB2-95DA-C113F97047E1">H1B</a> is applied by the company you work with, so you are tied to that company. And will have only 6 months to get another employer if you loose your job.</dd>

<dt>GreenCard is Lottery</dt><dd>Application of GreenCard is also needs to be done by your company, and it is expensive. So, unless your company is generous or your skills are very valuable, it is unlikely. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Moreover, since there are limited number of accepted people, the selection is based on luck</li>
</ul></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Canada has a housing problem in cities like Toronto, where the house price have skyrocketed. So, people live in cities like Ontario. 
</p>

<p>
Inspite of the difficulties, people still prefer to goto America becuase the pay is much higher. 2x, 3x the pay compared to Canada.
