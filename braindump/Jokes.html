3 Logicians

<p>

A genie and an idiot
</p>

<p>

Kid vs barber
</p>

<p>
A young boy enters a barber shop and the barber whispers to his customer. ‘This is the dumbest kid in the world. Watch while I prove it you.’ The barber puts a dollar bill in one hand and two quarters in the other, then calls the boy over and asks, ‘Which do you want, son?’ The boy takes the quarters and leaves. ‘What did I tell you?’ said the barber. ‘That kid never learns!’ Later, when the customer leaves, he sees the same young boy coming out of the ice cream store. ‘Hey, son! May I ask you a question? Why did you take the quarters instead of the dollar bill?’ The boy licked his cone and replied, ‘Because the day I take the dollar, the game is over!’

<b>Theoretical computer scientist is at an interview.</b>
</p>

<p>
Interviewer: “Imagine that you are walking down a road and see a house on fire. What do you do?”
</p>

<p>
CS Guy: “I dial the police and tell them that the house is on fire.”
</p>

<p>
Interviewer: “Good. Now, imagine that you are walking down the same road, and you see that the same house is not on fire. What do you do?”
</p>

<p>
CS Guy: <b>Ponders for a little while.</b> “I put the house on fire and reduce it to a problem I’ve solved before.”
