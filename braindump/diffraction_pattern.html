To find the actual/complete diffraction pattern we need to consider each point in
the slit as a source of light and find the resultant amplitude (actually
resultant electric field displacement) at the concerned point on the
screen. This involves some interesting maths and logic. But before
finding that infinte sum, lets look at a simplified finite case.
</p>


<div id="figure-1" class="figure">
<p><img src="data/diffraction_pattern/slit-n5.svg" alt="slit-n5.svg" class="org-svg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Here, we have shown only five points. Let each ray to inclined at \(\theta\)
angle and the slit width be \(d\). Suppose the electric displacement be
<a href="#amplitude">a</a>, wavelength of light be \(\lambda\) and the angular
velocity be \(\omega\). As shown in the figure, after points
<code>0′, 1′, 2′, 3′ &amp; 4′</code> all the rays travel same distance upto the screen
placed at infinity. Thus their resultant at the screen is same as their
resultant at those points (i.e. the sum of the displacements at those
points). At the starting points <code>0, 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4</code> on the slit each ray
can be represented by : \(y = a \sin(\omega t)\) but since the path
from original poisition to the primed (<code>′</code>) position is different for
different rays, and since they start at same phase, they are out of
phase when they reach the primed positions. The path difference between
cosecutive rays is \(\frac d 4 sin\theta = d′ \sin\theta\)
</p>

<p>
So corresponding phase diff is:
\(\Delta \beta = d′ \sin\theta  . \frac {2\pi} {\lambda}\) Thus now
the rays can be represented at primed position as:
</p>

\begin{align}
y_0 &= a \sin(\omega t) \\ y_1 &= a \sin(\omega t + \Delta \beta) \\ y_2 &= a \sin(\omega t + 2 \Delta \beta) \\ y_3 &= a \sin(\omega t + 3 \Delta \beta) \\ y_4 &= a \sin(\omega t + 4 \Delta \beta)
\end{align}

<p>
And the resultant is \(y = \sum_{i=0}^{i=4} {y_i}\)
</p>

<p>
Now, we just need to find the sum. Of course if we had actual data like,
<code>θ = 30°, a = 10 A°, λ = 642nm, ...</code> we could just put the values and
get the result :smiley: . But here we have to do this with all
variables. Also, if there were 2 or 3 terms only we could have expanded
the \(sin(\omega t + \Delta \beta)\) terms and got the sum (like in the
case of Young's double slit experiment's expressions). But, in this case
we have to later expand/generalize this to infinte terms as the segment
size goes to zero. So, we use a tool called phasor. I hope you are
familiar with it. If you aren't don't worry, the main thing about
phasors is that they represent expressions of the form
\(y = a \sin(\omega t)\) graphically. And their sums, for e.g. <code>(1)</code> can
also be represented graphically as :
</p>

<p>
(Here β = NΔβ where N = number of segments)
</p>

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Phasor diagram</p>
</div>

<p>
We might find a formula for the length of a diagonal joining <code>N</code> th sides (here 5th side)
of regular polygon whose each external angle is <code>Δβ</code> and sum of those
side is <code>Na</code>. Buts lets go to the real suff.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Dividing the slit into very small equal segments of width \(\Delta d = \frac d N\). We get phase difference of
\(\Delta \beta = \Delta d \sin\theta\) between rays of each segment.
So, as \(N \rightarrow \infty  Δd \rightarrow 0 \text{ and } a → 0\).
The \((N + 1)\) sides of the polygon tends to a circular arc. As shown
below :
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>Actual model</p>
</div>

<p>
After all these conceptual talk, lets proceed to some small
calculations. By geometry we can say,
</p>

\begin{align}
\frac {A} 2 &= r sin(\frac \beta 2)  & [\text{from triangle made by radius, half cord and normal}] \\
Also, \\
r \beta &= A_0 & [\text{by defination of circular measure}]\\
 \therefore \frac A 2 &= \frac {A_0} \beta \sin(\frac {\beta } 2)\\
 A &= A_0 \frac {\sin(\frac {\beta} 2)} {\frac {\beta} 2} \\
   &= A_0 \frac {\sin(\frac {d \sin\theta} 2)} {\frac {d \sinθ} 2} \\
\end{align}

<p>
Finally we know the amplitude/electric field displacement at the screen.
Plotting this looks like:

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 5: </span>Amplitude ratio vs β curve</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, the intensity can be calculated as :
</p>

\begin{align}
&\text{We know, }                                       &I    &\propto A^2 \\ &\text{So, intensity at the centre, θ=0 }               &I_0  &\propto A_0^2 &  \\ &\therefore                                             &I    &= I_0 \frac {A^2} {A_0^2} \\  &                                                       &I    &= \frac {\sin²{\frac {β} {2}}} {(\frac β 2)^2} \\
\end{align}

<p>
We can find the maxima and minima by differentiating intensity with
respect to β and equating to zero, we get :
</p>

\begin{align}
&1) & \sin{\frac β 2} &= 0  \\ &   & \implies β      &= 0 , 2π, 4π, 6π, ... \\ &2) & \frac β 2       &= \tan(\frac β 2) \\
\end{align}

<p>
The first set of values represent minima (except central maxima β = 0),
β = 2π is first minima, β = 4π is second minima and so on. A quick
search at <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+x%2F2+%3D+tan(x%2F2)">wolframalpha</a>
solves the second equation with following values
</p>

<p>
These values for maxima, get nearer to odd multiples of π for higher
order minimas.
</p>

I would like to conclude this with the following graph:

   Each section consists of many rays, while taking a
single ray passing through that slit, the amplitude of the rays is
representative of all the rays. By this I mean that the amplitude is
taken such that the intensity or the energy passing through that whole
section due to many rays, is equal to the the intensity of the single
ray.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-not-odd-half-integer-wavelength">
<p>
Some of you might be wondering, when the path difference between topmost
ray and bottom most ray was integer multiple of wavelength <code>nλ</code>, then
minima occured as all the displacements got cancled out (which we
observed (will observe in the future) by dividing the slit to <code>2N</code>
parts). Then by similar logic, when the path difference is odd
half-integer multiple of wavelength <code>(n+1)λ/2</code> we divide the slit to
<code>n+1</code> section, then shouldn't all the rays from <code>n</code> sections
destructively superimpose (cancle out) and the rays from remaining
section give rise to bright maxima?
</p>

<p>
No, because although the rays from the remaining section superimpose
constructively, the section itself is smaller. Actually there needs a
balance between the constructive superimposition and the section size.

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 7: </span>Phasor diagram when ray angle θ increase causing β to change</p>
</div>

<p>
In this figure, the dashed line indicates the resultant (or say the
intensity) and as we can see, the radius is always decreasing with
increasing β and when one circle completes the 1st minima occurs but the
1st secondary maxima doesn't occur when the arc completes another half
round. Because interestingly the diagonal (at β=540°) is shorter than
the cord (at β=515°=8.98) because the radius is always decreasing.
