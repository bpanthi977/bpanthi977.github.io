3Blue1Brown's fantastic video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA">Solving Wordle using Information Theory</a> introduced me to the game of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a>. In this article, I am going to implement a program to play the this game. My solution approach is identical to the one described in the video. However, I didn't look at Grant's code, and this is my own way of implementing what I learnt.
</p>

<p>
Wordle is a word guessing game. You get 6 chances to guess a 5 letter word. For each guess, the game reveals following information:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if any letter in your guess word is at the exact same location as in the answer word, it is marked green,</li>
<li>if any letter in your guess word exists in the answer word  but at a different location, it is marked yellow,</li>
<li>and the letters that don't exist in the answer word are marked black.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Using the revealed information, you narrow the possibilites and try to guess the correct word. As humans, we can intuitively think weather one guess might be better than other or not. "What exactly is a good guess?" is the main question. Or, put different, "What strategy for selecting guess words is the best?". Only when we answer this, we can implement that strategy in code and see the result. To answer this, observe that we tend to think of following strategies while playing overselves: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we would like to use words that have different letters than previous guesses,</li>
<li>even if we know the correct letters of few positions, its may be better to use words that have wrong letters at those positions, because we can then know if those letter exist or not at other positions of the answer word,</li>
<li>we give priority to vowels and other letters that are more frequent in most of the words.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is one central theme to these thoughts: <i>Increase the amount of information we can get from each guess</i>. If we use letters previously used, we get less information; If we test uncommon letters in the guess, on average we narrow down the possible words but much less than if we had tested common letters. Now, we need to quantify these notions. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4f011e5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4f011e5"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Probability &amp; Information</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Lets imagine, we are playing a different game. I think of a random number between 0 and 255, and your task is to guess it. Initially your probability of guessing the right one is $1/256 = 0.4\%. If I say, that the number is divisible by three. And the probability of the number being divisible by 3 is about \(33%\) and not being divisible by 3 is \(67%\). Then how much information did I reveal?. And, If I had said that the number is divisible by 2, then how much information would I be revealing?. Intuitively, you can guess that I would be revealing much more information in the former case than in the latter. As another example, if I had said that the number is not greater than 400, then I would not be revealing any information. Because the probability of the number being not greater than 400 is already known to be 100%. So, in this case where the probability of each number being the right one is equal, the amount of information revealed is higher if that information reduces the space of right answers by a large number. And in general, the amount of information revealed is higher for events of lesser probability and lesser for events of higher probability. i.e. Information is decreasing function of probability.
</p>

<p>
Now, lets look at this in another way. A number between 0 and 255 can be represented in binary by 8 digits (8 binary digits = 8 bits). e.g. 56 is <code>00111000</code>. And if I say that the number is divisible by 2, then it is the same as saying that the last digit in binary is <code>0</code>. We need 8 bits to represent the number, and I revealed one of those 8 bits. So, we can say I revealed 1 bit of information. Now, it shouldn't feel surprising that we can measure information in bits. Afterall, every information (documents, images, audio, &#x2026;) you store in your computer is stored in binary and their size measured in bits, bytes (8 bits = 1byte), MB (Mega Byte = 2<sup>20</sup> bytes), GB. Revealing that the last digit is divisible by 2, reduced the possible answers by 1/2 and gave 1 bit of information. If I said that the last two digits are <code>10</code> the possible answers would be reduced by 1/4th and this would be 2 bits of information. And if I reveal the right answer, it would reduce the possibilites to 1 out of all possible 256, i.e. 8 bits of information. So, information \(I\) is:
</p>

\begin{equation*}
I = - \log_2(P)
\end{equation*}
<p>
\(- \log_2(1/2) = 1\) bit, and \(-\log_2(1/4) = 2\) bits. 
Here, \(P\) is the probability of event = the amount by which the possibilites are reduced (because in this case each number is equally likely).
</p>

<p>
Now, we can answer the previous questions:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If I say that the number is divisible by 3, then I restrict the digits to some pattern. And it would be \(-\log_2(1/3) = 1.58\) bits of information.</li>
<li>If I say that the number is divisible by 2, then it would be \(-\log_2(1/2) = 1\) bit of information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
And as we had intuitively said previously, we can now numerically say that the former reveals higher information than the latter.   
</p>

<p>
Lets get back to wordle. Our target is to <i>increase the amount of information we can get from each guess</i>. There are 2315 words that can be right answers in the original wordle game.
</p>

<p>
In a wordle game instance where <code>sweet</code> is the right answer, using the guess word <code>crane</code> would show following colors:
</p>

<p>
<code class="src src-lisp">(human-color <span class="org-string">"crane"</span> <span class="org-string">"sweet"</span>)</code> 
</p>

<p>
And if we check every possible answer words, there are 127 words that would give the above color.

So, <code>crane</code> reduced the possibilites from 2315 words to 127 words, i.e. it revealed \(-\log_2 (127/2315) = 4.19\) bits of information. Lets denote this as:
</p>

\begin{equation*}
I(\textrm{crane}|\textrm{sweet}) = 4.19
\end{equation*}

<p>
However, if the right answer was <code>rebar</code>, then guessing <code>crane</code> would show <code class="src src-lisp">(human-color0 <span class="org-string">"crane"</span> <span class="org-string">"rebar"</span>)</code> and there would be <code class="src src-lisp">(count-possibilites <span class="org-string">"crane"</span> <span class="org-string">"byyby"</span>)</code> possible valid guesses. And thus in this game, <code>crane</code> revealed \(-\log_2(50/2315) = 5.53\) bits of information. However, if we had guessed <code>pearl</code> then for the first case it would show <code class="src src-lisp">(human-color  <span class="org-string">"pearl"</span> <span class="org-string">"sweet"</span>)</code> and reduce possibilites to <code class="src src-lisp">(count-possibilites <span class="org-string">"pearl"</span> <span class="org-string">"bybbb"</span>)</code> words (3.86 bits of information) and for the second case, it would show <code class="src src-lisp">(human-color <span class="org-string">"pearl"</span> <span class="org-string">"rebar"</span>)</code> and reduce possibilites to <code class="src src-lisp">(count-possibilites <span class="org-string">"pearl"</span> <span class="org-string">"bgyyb"</span>)</code> word (9.18  bits of information). So, crane is a better guess if the right answer is <code>sweet</code> while <code>pearl</code> is better guess if the right answer is <code>rebar</code>. But we don't beforehand what the right answer is. We are just one major concept far from addressing this problem and reaching our target. So, lets talk about entropy. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgebe8523" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgebe8523"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Entropy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Equiped with what we learned about information, we are now able to quantify what information is. And how it relates to the reduction in the number of possibilites. Also, we saw that the amount of information each guess would reveal depends on what the right answer is. But we don't now what the right answer is beforehand. So, for each guess, we can't say how much information some guess reveals but still we can compute the average (i.e. expected) value of the information we could get. In the above example, when we don't know what the right answer is, both <code>sweet</code> and <code>rebar</code> are equally likely and so are all other 2315 words. So, on average <code>crane</code> would reveal 
</p>

\begin{equation}
H(\textrm{crane}) = E[I(\textrm{crane})] =\frac 1 {2315} \sum_{w \belongs \textrm{D}} I(\textrm{crane}|w) = 5.74
\end{equation}

<p>
bits of information. \(E[I(w)]\) is the expected (average) value of information that the word \(w\) would reveal. This is also the entropy of the event. <i>Event</i> here being the event of guessing the word <code>crane</code>, and entropy being the amount of information we would get from the result of the <i>event</i> on average.
</p>

<p>
If you look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">wikipedia</a>, Entropy is defined as: 
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-verse">Given a discrete random variable $X$ with possible outcomes $x_1$, ..., $x_n$ with probability $P(x_1)$, ..., $P(x_n)$, the entropy is defined as 

\begin{equation}
H(X) = - \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) log(P(x_i))
\end{equation}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here our discrete random variable \(X\) is the result we get for a guess word (say <code>crane</code>), with possible outcomes <code class="src src-lisp">(human-color <span class="org-string">"crane"</span> <span class="org-string">"sweet"</span>)</code> , <code class="src src-lisp">(human-color <span class="org-string">"crane"</span> <span class="org-string">"rebar"</span>)</code> , &#x2026; with probability of occurances \(127/2315 = 5.5\%\), \(50/2315 = 2.2\%\), and the entropy of guess <code>crane</code> would be \(H(X) = 5.74\) bits. 
</p>

<p>
Finally!!! We can answer <i>`How to increase the amount of information we can get from each guess</i>?': Select the guess word such that the entropy of guess word is highest. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9c7d842" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9c7d842"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Lets play a game</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The right answer for this game is <code>focus</code> but we don't know this yet. So, our first guess would be the word that highest entropy over all possible answer words. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>crane</code> has an entropy of 5.74</li>
<li><code>pearl</code> has an entropy of 5.53</li>
<li><p>
while <code>soare</code> has the highest entropy of 5.89
</p>

<p>
So, our first guess is soare. 
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
<code class="src src-lisp">(human-color <span class="org-string">"soare"</span> <span class="org-string">"focus"</span>)</code> 
</p>

<p>
Now, from this color pattern we can figure out, by going through all words in the dictionary, that there are <code class="src src-lisp">(count-possibilites <span class="org-string">"soare"</span> <span class="org-string">"ygbbb"</span>)</code> possible words:

Assuming that each of the words above is equally likely to be the right answer, the average information that <code>bonus</code> would reveal is <code class="src src-lisp">(entropy (index <span class="org-string">"bonus"</span>) (valid-guesses (encode <span class="org-string">"soare"</span> <span class="org-string">"ygbbb"</span>)))</code> bits. Where as the word <code>thumb</code> would reveal the highest amount of information on average of <code class="src src-lisp">(entropy (index <span class="org-string">"thumb"</span>) (valid-guesses (encode <span class="org-string">"soare"</span> <span class="org-string">"ygbbb"</span>)))</code> bits. 
</p>

<p>
With the next guess <code>thumb</code> resulting the following color: 
</p>

<p>
<code class="src src-lisp">(human-color <span class="org-string">"thumb"</span> <span class="org-string">"focus"</span>)</code> 
</p>

<p>
We now have only <code class="src src-lisp">(length (valid-guesses (encode <span class="org-string">"soare"</span> <span class="org-string">"ygbbb"</span> <span class="org-string">"thumb"</span> <span class="org-string">"bbybb"</span>)))</code>  valid guesses: 
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-lisp">(map 'list #'index-&gt;word (valid-guesses (encode <span class="org-string">"soare"</span> <span class="org-string">"ygbbb"</span> <span class="org-string">"thumb"</span> <span class="org-string">"bbybb"</span>)))
</pre>
</div>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">focus</td>
<td class="org-left">locus</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Now, the entropy of each of the two words is 1 bit because they can only half the possibilites. Each one can be either right or wrong. At this point, our next guess could be <code>focus</code> and we complete the game in 3 steps.
